## What do you really think? Using the ORJI cycle to find your own biases

From *Process Consulting Volume II* by Edgar H. Schein.

The most important thing for managers or consultants to understand is what goes on inside their own heads.

Our nervous system is simultaneously a data gathering system, a processing system, and a proactive managing system. That is we:
* *Observe*
* *React* emotionally to what we have observed
* Analyze, process and make *judgements* based on observations and feelings
* we behave overtly in order to make something happen, we *intervene*

Although we can lay this out in a sequential process as shown in the figure, real intrapsychic processes don’t occur in such a simple, logical sequence. The model helps us simplify such processes.



### Observation
* Observation should be the accurate registering through all of our senses of what is actually occurring in the environment.
* However, psychoanalytic theory has shown us how extensive perceptual distortion can be. 
    * *Denial*- refusing to see certain categories of information as they apply to ourselves
    * *Projection*- seeing in others what is actually operating in ourselves
* One of the most difficult tasks is suspending pre-judgement, to become acquainted with one’s own defense mechanisms, to correct for expectations and preconceptions so as to be able to “see” and “hear” more accurately what is going on.

### Reaction
* The most difficult aspect of emotion reaction is that we often do not notice it at all. We deny feelings or take them so for granted that we, in effect, short-circuit them and move straight into judgements and actions.
    * We learn early in life that there are many situations where feelings should be “controlled”, “suppressed”, “overcome” and in various other ways “deleted” or denied.
    * If we can learn to identify our true feelings and what triggers our feelings, then we have a choice whether or not to give into those feelings.
    * If we do not know what they are or what causes them, we are de facto victims of them.

### Judgement
* Jaques (1976, 1982) has noted that one of the ways that different levels of management can be distinguished is by the time horizon that they consider and by the length of the time units over which they are given direction.
    * Thus workers on the shop floor may have autonomy over minutes, hours or days
    * Low-level managers, over days or weeks
    * Senior managers over months and years
* Ones judgement is often “logical” but based on “facts” that may not be accurate, hence the outcome may not be logical at all. The most dangerous part of the cycle is the first step, where we make attributions and prejudgments rather than focusing as much as possible on what really happened.

### Intervention
* Knee-jerk reactions that get us into trouble are interventions that are judgements based on incorrect data, not necessarily bad judgements.
* When we say that someone acted “emotionally” instead of logically, we usually mean that he or she acted inappropriately to the situation, that we could not see the data that would warrant the kind of behavior we observed in the person.
    * When we interview the “emotional” person, we often find that the behavior was rational and logical from the person’s point of view, that the person “observed” something that made him or her rationally react to that observation.
    * If the behavior was inappropriate it was not because it was not rational but because it was based on incorrect initial observation.
