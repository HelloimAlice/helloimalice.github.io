## On Judging Emotional Reactions

>Knee-jerk reactions that get us into trouble are interventions that are judgements based on incorrect data, not necessarily bad judgements.
>When we say that someone acted “emotionally” instead of logically, we usually mean that he or she acted inappropriately to the situation, that we could not see the data that would warrant the kind of behavior we observed in the person.
    * When we interview the “emotional” person, we often find that the behavior was rational and logical from the person’s point of view, that the person “observed” something that made him or her rationally react to that observation.
    * If the behavior was inappropriate it was not because it was not rational but because it was based on incorrect initial observation.
